# project overview
Uninte to harvest change! United Harvest Festival, a Three-day experience you cant miss. Your time here is important and supports a good cause. The United Farm workers of America, these are the hardest working people in this country and yet are still not treated fairly for the work that they do. United Harvest is a celebration of the people who work incredibly hard to bring families fresh foods on a daily basis. 

This three day event kicks off with an opening ceremony with speeches from union leaders, university officials, and community representatives. There are cultural performances, including music, dance, and art exhibitions. The event closes out day one with a Unity dinner featuring foods from various cultures, prepared by local chefs and farmers.

Day two consists of leadership and action workshops, panel discussions on social justice, labor rights, and environmental sustainability. Cultural vendors with food and merch available will be present around the quad area. Along with this, volunteer activities, such as community garden work, educational outreach, and food distribution will also be present. Enjoy our film screenings highlighting the struggles and triumphs of farmworkers, followed by discussions about those topics closing out day two.

The third and final day will continue with a farmer's market, showcasing local produce and products, with the proceeds benefiting the union. Guests can enjoy live music performances, craft vendors, and interactive art installations. Then, a closing ceremony concert featuring local and regional artists celebrating the festival's success.
