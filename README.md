# project overview
Harvest change! The United Harvest Festival is an experience you shouldn't miss. Your experience is important and supports those in the UFW. The United Farm workers of America are the hardest working people in this country and yet still are not treated fairly for the work that they do. United Harvest is a celebration of the people who work so hard to bring fresh food to families on a daily basis. 

This three day event kicks off with an opening ceremony with speeches from union leaders, university officials, and community representatives. There will be cultural performances, including music, dance, and art exhibitions. The event closes out day one with a Unity dinner featuring foods from various cultures, prepared by local chefs and farmers.

Day two consists of leadership and action workshops , panel discussions on social justice, labor rights, and environmental sustainability. There will be cultural vendors with food and merch available around the quad area. There will be volunteer activities, such as community garden work, educational outreach, and food distribution. Enjoy our film screenings highlighting the struggles and triumphs of farmworkers, followed by discussions about those topics closing out day two.

The third and final day will continue the farmer's market, showcasing local produce and products, with the proceeds benefiting the union. Guests can enjoy live music performances, craft vendors, and interactive art installations. Then, a closing ceremony with a concert featuring local and regional artists celebrating the festival's success.
